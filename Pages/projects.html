    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>My interest in computer science has always been one of building.  I enjoy creating interesting and useful applications that build on the technologies used by companies such as Google and Oracle.  I have worked primarily in Java, but I have also explored other areas such as game development in the <a href=”http://unity3d.com/5”>Unity</a> engine.  I enjoy exploring new areas of technology as well, such as web-development through <a href=https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/>Googles polymer</a> framework.  Listed below are some of the projects I have enjoyed building and continuing to work on.  In addition, more of my work can be found on my <a href=https://github.com/cd24>GitHub</a> account.  </p>

                <h1><a href="https://github.com/cd24/GuessWho2/">GuessWho v2.0</a></h1>
                <p>GuessWho v2.0 is a version of the classic game Guess Who.  Similarly, users chat back and forth.  Questioning each other until one is able to successfully guess the others image.  This game is written in Java, and uses sockets to communicate between members.  This is a peer-to-peer game, so it is best played on LAN.  This project is still in the works, and is part of my CSCI 250 (Scalable Software Development) class.  </p>

                <h1><a href="https://github.com/cd24/CSCI250_ToDoList">ToDo List</a></h1>
                <p>This ToDo list is designed around making use of JavaFXs new features.  In this sense, the ToDo list uses a custom listview cell factory to generate custom cells.  Creating custom cells gives my application the ability to use a custom data structure representation that takes advantage of Java 8’s ObservableList data structure.  This makes the flow of data through the application relatively streamlined.  While there are still a few bugs, this application is mostly functional.  </p>

                <h1><a href="https://github.com/cd24/LogoInterpreter">Logo Interpretor</a></h1>
                <p>My Logo Interpreter is designed around introducing new programmers to the Logo language.  It is designed to give the user the ability to issue single commands, write more complex scripts and functions.  In my edition of the logo language, recursion is highly supported as a form of looping, however the ‘repeat’ call is still a viable way to loop.  This application, written in java, takes advantage of the grambler string parser to construct parse trees.  I really enjoyed writing this application, and it is under constant work.  </p>
