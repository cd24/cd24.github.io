    <p>My name is John McAvey and I have been involved in Information Technology and Computer Science for the bulk of my life.  My interests in biology and computer science have provided me the oppertunity to continually grow as a life-long learner.  My work as an IT infrastructure techinitian has given me insight into how technology is being employed to revolutionize the workplace as well as how to quickly and effectively create minimalist functional environments.  This experience has helped me to develop intuitive user interfaces for applications I design.  In addition to my work at school, I enjoy physical activites such as basketball, and historical martial arts such as german longsword.</p>

            <P>
                While at MRE consulting I worked as both an infrastructure consultant and a ASP.NET C# developer.  Working at MRE, I was explroed to various technologies such as Microsofts SCCM, Windows Server, Active Directory, and WDS tools.  In addition, I worked as a technitian to support both Mac OS X and Windows in a enterprise environment.  While working as a developer, I was able to design several web applications used for the onboarding process for various firms.

            <h5>Web Design</h5>
            <p>
                To this day, I enjoy playing with web systems such as Googles Polymer, AngularJS and Microsofts ASP.NET frameworks.  Each of these has their own appeal (and polymer and angular overlap in many ways) and I enjoy developing dynamic sites and web applications within these frameworks.  The web is the future of computing, and frameworks such as these enable significantly more powerful web experiences.  I have become a huge fan of Adobes <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> editor.  The live preview feature is extremely useful.

            <h5>Mobile Development</h5>
            <p>
                One of my friends in college introduced me to mobile development on iOS.  I must admit, Apple has created an increadibly useful and intuitive set of API's that allow developers to create mobile apps with ease.  I am working to design native and web-based applications that run well on mobile platforms.  I still enjoy tinkering with iOS and Android libraries to create innovative ways to greet the world!
