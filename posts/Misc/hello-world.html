<p>Today I am rolling out the new version of my personal site. I spent quite some time looking at various toolstacks and technologies. This post will provide some insight into my choice for my site base: <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>.</p>
<p>As with all problems, the first and hardest part is figuring out what is should do. When I built the first version of my site, I placed aesthetic above performance. This was fine while I was accessing my site from my site from my home internet, but I foolishly attempted to share the site with one of my colleagues over 3G cellular - it didnâ€™t go well. So I set out to redesign the site with performance and aesthetics in mind. I wanted a site which was both fast and easy to read.</p>
<p>To this end, I decided to emulate a reader mode as closely as possible. Reader modes have become common place because websites are <em>too busy</em>. Since my hosting is GitHub Pages, I am also limited to client-only systems.</p>
<p>Lastly, whatever system my page is built in should be extensible. However, simplicity should not be given at the cost of configuration or extension. Whatever system I use should expose a way for me to write my own features.</p>
<p>I limited myself to static site generators for simplicity. When I first started looking into them I found the usual suspects: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. Jekyll offered nice integrations with GitHub Pages, but I found that I couldnâ€™t customize the output beyond some templating. It really lived up to its name as a blogging software. After comparing the two, the main difference appeared to be how fast it could generate the site. Lastly, a friend of mine recommended Hakyll. Hakyll was slower than the other two, but essentially provides a library for you to build your own static site builder.</p>
<p>Despite the performance hit, the ease of configuration and customization offered by Hakyll won me over and so. Here we are, now I just need to think some more about themes ðŸ¤”</p>
