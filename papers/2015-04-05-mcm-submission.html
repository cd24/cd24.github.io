        <p>Transoceanic fight has become a regular occurrence; there are as many as 770 transatlantic fights aloneper day (1). However, when a aircraft flies over an ocean it becomes signicantly more dicult to track by radar. For this reason, it is dicult to find aircraft that have lost contact with their respective control towers. Finding downed aircraft quickly is vital to the safety of passengers and faith of the consumers. This paper explores techniques to minimize the search space and increase the chance of success for rescue teams. Recieving the honor of meritoruious, this paper was among the top 10% of thousands of papers submitted world-wide.</p>
