I currently work for Apple as a software engineer on the Internationalization team. I work to develop new ways for people of all languages to interact with their devices in clear and concise ways.
Notable technologies used here:

- Unicode
- Objective-c, Swift, UIKit, and AppKit
- Compiler design and implementation
